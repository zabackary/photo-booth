# Photo booth

This is a photo booth application, obviously.

For now, the main branch contains a version which calls a callback service with
a token to email recipients (this is implemented as a Google Apps Script web
app, but you can pick the implementation). If the need arises, I will add
options to use a physical printer instead.
